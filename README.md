# midi-synth
Simple MIDI synth in c++ that recocnizes any USB MIDI keyboard and lets user play it without any additional software. Doesn't require any additional software. To reduce lag, use USB 3.0 or faster.
Tested with VirtualMIDISynth and FluidR3_GM soundfont because they provide less lag than sdandard Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth. Synth settings can only be adjusted using a MIDI controller
