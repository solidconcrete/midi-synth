# midi-synth
Simple MIDI synth in c++. Doesn't require any additional software. To reduce lag, use USB 3.0 or faster.
Tested with VirtualMIDISynth and FluidR3_GM soundfont because they provide less lag than sdandard Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth. Synth settings can only be adjusted using a MIDI controller
